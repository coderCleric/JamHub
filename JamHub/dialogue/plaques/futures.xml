				Mod: Uncertain Futures&#13;&#10;Author: Clay
			</Page>
			<Page>Uncertain Futures is a cancelled story mod, with quantum objects playing a central role.</Page>
			<Page>The mod was designed to emulate the traditional gameplay loop of Outer Wilds as closely as possible, as well as providing an alternate ending to the events that take place in the base game and DLC.</Page>
			<Page>Not only that, but Uncertain Futures tried to flesh out an underutilized location, and take advantage of certain opportunities that the base game did not.</Page>
			<Page>While not much concrete was known about the mod, what is for certain is that its legacy will live on in the Outer Wilds modding community.</Page>
