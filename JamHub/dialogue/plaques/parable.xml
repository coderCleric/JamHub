        Mod: The Hearthian Parable&#13;&#10;Authors: Vambok
	  </Page>
      <Page>The Hearthian Parable is a mod made for the fifth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. It was a small mod thrown together in the last three days of the jam.</Page>
      <Page>While Vambok's team decided to quit the jam, Vambok decided to make something out of what was left. Now, it's a fully voice acted experience with lots of funny moments and five endings.</Page>
