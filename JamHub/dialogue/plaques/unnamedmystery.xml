        Mod: Unnamed Mystery&#13;&#10;Author: orbital32
      </Page>
      <Page>Unnamed Mystery is a story mod originally designed to be a submission to the first mod jam, but was released as a standalone because it didn't fit the theme.</Page>
      <Page>The mod is about a group of Nomai getting stranded in a star system located just outside the bounds of the universe.</Page>
      <Page>Unnamed Mystery was able to deliver a great story mod without the use of code, but its story is still not complete.</Page>
	  <Page>The developer has also recently announced their plans to completely remaster the mod.</Page>
