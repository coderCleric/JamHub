        Mod: Escape Room&#13;&#10;Authors: xen, GameWyrm
	  </Page>
      <Page>Escape Room is an example mod made for the third mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. Since it was made by two judges, this entry did not count.</Page>
      <Page>The mod features a series of puzzle rooms that the player must solve to proceed, and all of these puzzles use almost no text at all, providing a good example for other jam modders.</Page>
