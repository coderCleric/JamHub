        Mod: Root Access&#13;&#10;Authors: John Corby, 2walker2, Lezzlebit
	  </Page>
      <Page>Root Access is one of the mods that won third place in the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. Like its name suggests, your goal is to gain root access to the simulation.</Page>
      <Page>The puzzles in this mod are quality, well-conveyed with the restriction, and unveils a great surprise about halfway through. This mod was also the first to make Geswaldo, Ernesto's husband, the easter egg.</Page>
      <Page>With the wonders that this team has made, it's no wonder why Root Access was able to get into the top 3.</Page>
