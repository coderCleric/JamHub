        Mod: Extinction&#13;&#10;Author: Bird
      </Page>
      <Page>Extinction is one of the story mods that has spent the longest time in development, but has been abandoned for quite a while.</Page>
      <Page>The mod has a dedicated thread in the nh-addon-dev channel of the modding Discord, but the channel has been archived since early 2023.</Page>
      <Page>While not much is known of the mod in general except for those who worked on it, what we do know is that it will be about the origin of Dark Bramble.</Page>
