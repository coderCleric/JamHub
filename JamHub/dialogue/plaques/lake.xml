        Mod: Lonesome Lake&#13;&#10;Authors: Asymmetrical Cavern
      </Page>
      <Page>Lonesome Lake is a mod made for the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. The mod is very short, yet impactful.</Page>
      <Page>While I can't say much about the mod without spoiling it entirely, it takes place on a vessel constructed by a group of Inhabitants.</Page>
      <Page>While it didn't win any awards, it is an experience worth trying!</Page>
