        Mod: A Dream of Home&#13;&#10;Authors: Classic
      </Page>
      <Page>A Dream of Home was one of the most anticipated mods for Outer Wilds, taking place in the home system of the Stranger's Inhabitants featuring a re-terraformed version of their home moon.</Page>
      <Page>It has gained its own following during its development thanks to its trailers gaining popularity, and it has its own Discord server with more members than the Outer Wilds Modding server itself!</Page>
      <Page>But those many people were left heartbroken when the developer lost all his files, and all that's left is an outdated version on GitHub. After that, the mod had since been cancelled.</Page>
      <Page>However, the legacy of A Dream of Home lives on and has inspired many people into modding Outer Wilds, including Anonymous, the creator of The Stranger They Are.</Page>
