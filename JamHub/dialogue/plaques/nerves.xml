        Mod: Nerves of Darkness&#13;&#10;Authors: Anonymous
      </Page>
      <Page>Nerves of Darkness was a mod idea that Anonymous wanted to make after The Stranger They Are if they had time. It would take place in a star system orbiting a supermassive black hole.</Page>
	  <Page>The mod would have been centric around using sound as a means of communication and puzzle solving, as Echoes of the Eye did with vision. Signals, audio tapes, and other sound cues would have been involved.</Page>
	  <Page>The ultimate goal of the player would be to learn how to enter the black hole safely, and once they do, they will be able to explore a dark, unnerving structure at the singularity built by an exotic, photophobic new species...</Page>
	  <Page>But TSTA past both its August and September 2024 deadlines and Anonymous decided not to work on the mod, but instead leave behind a GitHub repository with concept art and a concept system made with New Horizons.</Page>
      <Page>Perhaps one day this mod could be picked up and revived like Anonymous wanted, could that person be you?</Page>
