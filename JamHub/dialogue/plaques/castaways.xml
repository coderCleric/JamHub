        Mod: Forgotten Castaways&#13;&#10;Author: coderCleric
      </Page>
      <Page>Forgotten Castaways is a story mod that takes place almost entirely in Dark Bramble, tasking the player with following the trail of the four Nomai that became stranded there.</Page>
      <Page>Despite taking place in Dark Bramble, the mod attempts to make the location (somewhat) less intimidating, hoping to allow those who are not fond of the planet to play it.</Page>
      <Page>(I’m also the one making Forgotten Castaways, so you can’t stop me from including it here!)</Page>
