        Mod: Fret's Quest&#13;&#10;Author: Samster68
      </Page>
      <Page>Fret's Quest is one of the first story mod for Outer Wilds, sending players on a quest to find a magical banjo which was stolen from a Nomai named Fret.</Page>
      <Page>The mod may seem like it's a bit of a joke, but it's much more than that. It has lore, surprises, characters, and was the first mod to do quite a few things.</Page>
      <Page>What's certain is that Fret's Quest is a mod worth playing, and that it was a milestone for the Outer Wilds modding community.</Page>
