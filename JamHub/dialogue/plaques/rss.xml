      <Page>While RSS does exist on the mod database, it is only a preview of what is to come for this mod. It is still being worked on and story elements are planned for the full release.</Page>
      <Page>Not much is commonly known of RSSâ€™s story as it is not mentioned on the mod page, but it is still a mod that has many (including myself) looking forward to the full release.</Page>
      <Page>Even without the story elements, RSS is still a lot of fun to fly around. Getting to see our solar system in Outer Wilds in a neat experience, and well worth the download.</Page>
