        Mod: New Horizons
        Author: Xen, Bwc9876, JohnCorby, MegaPiggy, Clay, Trifid, and friends
      </Page>
      <Page>New Horizons is the mod enabling almost all of the story mods created by the community, with dozens of mods making use of it.</Page>
      <Page>Allowing the creation of custom planets, systems, text, dialogue, and more with simple json and XML files, this mod enables those not confident in programming to create their own puzzles and stories.</Page>
      <Page>The first mod jam in January of 2023 demonstrated the kinds of experiences that creatives could craft with New Horizons, and more recent mods have shown what is possible when this tool is combined with custom code.</Page>
      <Page>New Horizons is actively maintained by members of the community and (despite Xen’s insistence that it is complete) is frequently receiving new features.</Page>
