        Mod: Time Dilator&#13;&#10;Authors: orbital32
      </Page>
      <Page>Time Dilator is a mod made for the first Outer Wilds Mod Jam, which explores a new star system with a strange property.</Page>
	  <Page>Originally, orbital32 intended to release Unnamed Mystery as a jam submission, but instead worked on a new mod because the former did not fit with the theme.</Page>
      <Page>While it didn't win any awards, it is an experience worth trying!</Page>
