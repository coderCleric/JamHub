      <Page>This platform showcases the winners of the modding community’s fifth mod jam, held in July of 2025 with the theme of “Miniature”.</Page>
      <Page>This jam had a special restriction, modders were required to make a small star system that is no bigger than 2500 meters in radius, all of which were in one shared system.</Page>
      <Page>Much like Jam 3, this allowed for a more connected experience, and allowed all the modders to do some rich worldbuilding for the once lonely Nomai Vessel in the center.</Page>
      <Page>If you want to, you can meet the creators of these mods at the party on the north pole!</Page>
