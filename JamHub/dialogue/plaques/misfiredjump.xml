        Mod: Misfired Jump&#13;&#10;Authors: Echatsum
	  </Page>
      <Page>Misfired Jump is one of the mods that won third place in the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. Thanks to Slate's mistakes, you are stranded in an entirely new system.</Page>
      <Page>The mod was made by the same developer of Callis's Thesis, and he has really improved a lot since then. The mod has actual puzzles, and creative ones, too.</Page>
      <Page>This mod is certainly an experience and abides by the restriction quite well. It's no wonder why it was able to get into the top 3.</Page>
