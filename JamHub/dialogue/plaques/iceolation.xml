        Mod: Iceolation&#13;&#10;Authors: pikpik, Shoe, TextureTurtle, ThyToxic
      </Page>
      <Page>Iceolation is a mod made for the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. While the mod was sadly released in an unfinished state, the mod still has a lot of potential.</Page>
      <Page>The mod has no functioning puzzles, but has a small story and five shiplog entries put together. It tells the story of a new, aquatic species living beneath the ice of a frozen planet that discovered the Eye's signal.</Page>
      <Page>While it didn't win any awards or release in a finished state, it's still worth checking out!</Page>
