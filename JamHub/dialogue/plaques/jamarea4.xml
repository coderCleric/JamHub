      <Page>This platform showcases the winners of the modding community’s fourth mod jam, held in October of 2024 with the themes of “Isolation” and "Escape".</Page>
      <Page>This jam had a special restriction, forcing modders to use minimal text in their mods. The restriction proved itself challenging, as some modders have struggled.</Page>
      <Page>However, this restriction allowed for the creation of some great DLC-based mods which before were not as plentiful.</Page>
      <Page>If you want to, you can meet the creators of these mods at the party on the north pole!</Page>
