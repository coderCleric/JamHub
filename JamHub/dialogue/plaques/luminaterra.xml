        Mod: Lumina Terra&#13;&#10;Authors: Etherpod, Ditzy
	  </Page>
      <Page>Lumina Terra is the mod that won second place in the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. The mod takes place on a lonely planet orbiting a weak star.</Page>
      <Page>This mod is best enjoyed with Traveler's Pack, because of the amount of items the player will be picking up. One of these items also happens to have a neat mechanic.</Page>
      <Page>Lumina Terra handles the restriction quite well, and its main mechanic is quite a suprise when you figure it out. It's definitely worth playing!</Page>
