        Mod: Astral Codec
Author: 2walker2
      </Page>
      <Page>Astral Codec is a recently released mod that may be the largest story mod ever created by the community (at the time of writing, at least).</Page>
      <Page>As stated on the mod page, Astral Codec explores a possible origin of the Interloper, but don’t think that that’s all this mod has to offer! The story the mod presents is interesting, and the characters used and created are charismatic and fun to listen to.</Page>
      <Page>As a bonus, the “Astral Codec Help” thread in the general mod chat of the modding discord is a great place to get help if you get stuck, or even just discuss the mod with others who have finished it.</Page>
