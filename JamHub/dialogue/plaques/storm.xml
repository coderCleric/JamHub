        Mod: Eye of the Storm&#13;&#10;Authors: Nolram, JohnCorby, and friends
      </Page>
      <Page>Eye of the Storm was a cancelled mod for Outer Wilds that unveils a new Nomai project called the WASP that was built after the Ash Twin Project before the Interloper came.</Page>
      <Page>The mod was in pre-development stage for two years and several arguments between the developers over design choices caused the mod to ultimately be cancelled.</Page>
      <Page>Not much of it is very well known by the Outer Wilds modding community, but there's no reason for this mod with great potential to be forgotten.</Page>
