        Mod: Broken Balance&#13;&#10;Authors: TetraMinus and Aidancode
      </Page>
      <Page>Broken Balance is a mod made for the first Outer Wilds Mod Jam, which the author describes as still "barebones". It takes place in a new system with a silver star which three planets call home.</Page>
      <Page>The mod's story explores a new clan of Nomai's faults and discoveries, and has three unique planets. One covered in gears, another one that's hollow, and a third covered in minerals.</Page>
      <Page>While the mod itself claims to be barebones, there's still a story and three planets to explore.</Page>
