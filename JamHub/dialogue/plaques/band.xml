	  </Page>
      <Page>Band Together is a mod made for the third mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. It takes place on a planet with four divided tribes.</Page>
      <Page>The player's main goal is to unite the four tribes together to figure out how to open a long-locked ancient door.</Page>
	  <Page>While the mod was left in an unfinished state by the jam deadline, updates followed and fixed the mod, turning it into the wonderful mod it is today.</Page>
      <Page>While it didn't win any awards, it is an experience worth trying!</Page>
