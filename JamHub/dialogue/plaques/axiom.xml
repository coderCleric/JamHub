        Mod: Axiom's Refuge&#13;&#10;Authors: MegaPiggy
	  </Page>
      <Page>Axiom's Refuge is a mod made for the third mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community, bringing the world of the Outer Wilds Alpha Version to the final release.</Page>
      <Page>This crossover may not have had any puzzles involved, but it has a great story and melds the two worlds together quite well.</Page>
      <Page>While it didn't win any awards, it is an experience worth trying!</Page>
