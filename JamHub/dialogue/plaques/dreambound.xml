        Mod: Dreambound&#13;&#10;Authors: Hawkbar, Insmoshable
	  </Page>
      <Page>Dreambound is the mod that won first place in the fourth mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community. The mod introduces itself by showing a mirage of the Ringed Planet around Giant's Deep.</Page>
      <Page>Dreambound's central mechanic revolves around a device that can scan and point to several objects in order to find them, and with it you can uncover an untold story of the Stranger's Inhabitants.</Page>
      <Page>The mod does a great job at conveying information to the player with minimal text, and has really proven itself worthy of first prize.</Page>
