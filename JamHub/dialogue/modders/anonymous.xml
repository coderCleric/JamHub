			<Page>that's because it's so goddamn bright out there. i hate light.</Page>
			<Page>don't get me wrong, i think all the other modders are great people to talk to, and i love the community.</Page>
			<Page>*sigh* i wish i could have the chance to run into some of them in real life. that would change everything.</Page>

			<Page>my work? yes, i've made the stranger they are and helped develop the cosmic curators.</Page>
			<Page>tsta is something i feel mixed about, because it's given me such frusturation during development, yet some other things i'm proud of.</Page>
			<Page>honestly, i shit on my own mods for shits and giggles. i know i've made a great mod, i'm proud of it, but i don't want to be that person who just annoyingly promotes their mod.</Page>
			<Page>curators on the other hand went completely smoothly, and it's mostly because i've learned from my mistakes in the stranger they are. i designed most of the puzzles for that mod.</Page>
			<Page>what were those mistakes?</Page>
			<Page>1. don't edit too much things in base game, or things will break. (tsta did that a lot!)</Page>
			<Page>2. don't mess with quantum stuff too much. (it's what caused clay to stop modding and some bugs that still remain in tsta)</Page>
			<Page>i hope that people can learn from my mistakes and avoid them when modding. it's these two things that caused tsta to have so many bugs and spend another several months in bug fixing hell.</Page>

			<Page>i'm glad to ask!</Page>
			<Page>first, let me get the elephant out of the room. forgotten castaways.</Page>
			<Page>no, cleric is not paying me to say this! i love that mod so much!</Page>
			<Page>i've always found dark bramble fun, even with the anglerfish! so i immediately fell in love with this mod when i playtested it for cleric.</Page>
			<Page>i also highly recommend the outsider, which used to be my favorite before castaways. it too was dark bramble related, but has a nice little mix of dlc in it. (i also love the dlc)</Page>
			<Page>there's also a lot more i recommend. the hearth's neighbor series, band together, dreambound, evacuation, hearth1an's mods, root access, unnamed mystery, heliostudy, project arc, mindscapes...</Page>
			<Page>...fret's quest, quasar project, finis, symbiosis, tesseract's secret, astral codec, lonesome lake, on a rail!, under a radio moon, core collapse, and the box! especially the box!</Page>
			<Page>oh! and i playtested for eyes of the past, easily one of my top 3 mods. keep an eye for that one when it comes out!</Page>
			<Page>also uh, you can check out my mods too i guess, if you want. i don't like boasting about it too much.</Page>
			<Page>...wait, do i hear snoring? do i have to say all that again? too bad, i'm not!</Page>

			<Page>you know that one nintendo direct that went "you have 22 minutes until the solar system is destroyed"?</Page>
			<Page>yeah. that one.</Page>
			<Page>i didn't buy it until later that year and i neglected it for a while, and finally beat it at the very beginning of 2023.</Page>
			<Page>by the way, my first planet i visited was dark bramble! i thought it was cool so i went in it and landed on top of the red seed thinking it was a place to land...then i died to an anglerfish lol.</Page>
			<Page>when i did finish outer wilds, i bought the dlc a few months later. it took me less than a month to beat the dlc, and not long after i started installing mods.</Page>
			<Page>my first mod was the vision, then i played the outsider. i enjoyed both, and then i kept playing mods until i decided one day to mess around with new horizons.</Page>
			<Page>i messed with mods in my spare time, and even had a prototype for tsta, until i realized the inhabitant kit wiki became public, which made me want to join the server and get access.</Page>
			<Page>then, i wanted to bring my idea to life. i've had tsta as an idea since early november of 2023, and then it finally released about 1 and a half years later.</Page>
			<Page>i left the server for a bit, and came back because i wanted to participate in jam 5, and i ended up working with pik and stache to make cosmic curators as the main programmer.</Page>
			<Page>at the end, i helped cleric breathe new life into the mod jam mod, and then...i left for good.</Page>

			<Page>can't share that too much because i want to be anonymous.</Page>
			<Page>the internet is a dangerous place, and i've had some bad interactions in the past. when i wanted to join the modding community, i wanted to anonymize myself due to those past experiences.</Page>
			<Page>every public sector of the web has that drama and toxcicity that breaks out...but not the outer wilds modding community. it's impressive how lacking of these things the server is.</Page>

			<Page>modding has proven to be a consuming part of my life, and i want to fully retire. because i have a lot of drive, i would spend all my free time modding. so what good is being in the modding server if you're not modding?</Page>
			<Page>and even if neither if those were true, there's something about leaving that....sort of gives me peace. i can't really describe it.</Page>
			<Page>i don't hate anybody. it's honestly more of a lifestyle choice. i'm doing this for the betterment for myself.</Page>
			<Page>i won't forget the great times i had in the server. thank you, outer wilds community.</Page>
