		<Page>Hi, Iâ€™m orclecle.</Page>
		<Page>I was an author of Translation and Patches for The Outsider, and this addon has already been integrated into The Outsider.</Page>
		<Page>My main contribution was making Japanese translations of some mods, and I also made some jam mods: Finis, Guardian, and Diorama. (The time difference issue makes me hesitate to join some team.)</Page>
		<Page>.....Of course, I know I should reboot Pick Up Chert. This is the time.</Page>
