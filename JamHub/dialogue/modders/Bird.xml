			<Page>Hey there! I'm Bird.</Page>
			<Page>Extinction is a mod I started working on a few years ago. I got about halfway through it, but I eventually stopped because I had lost a lot of ambition and was moving on to other things.</Page>
			<Page>Most of what was left involved coding and writing, implementing puzzles and text, connecting everything, finishing a few structures, and playtesting.</Page>
			<Page>Some ideas from Extinction ended up inspiring my Jam 3 mod, Symbiosis, so go check that out.</Page>
			<Page>You can find me on the Outer Wilds modding discord as "Bird"!</Page>
