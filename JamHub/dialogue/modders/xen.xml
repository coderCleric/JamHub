			<Page>Hey it's me xen.</Page>
			<Page>If you've played any story mod ever I probably helped get it made - I'm the lead developer of the New Horizons story mod framework! I also organized the first 5 community mod jams.</Page>
			<Page>I always wanted to make story mods, but got so caught up in helping others make them that I never really got around to it myself. The only story mods I've actually made were Escape the Dreamstalker and Granite's Invitation.</Page>
			<Page>I also helped make Escape Room and Christmas Story.</Page>
			<Page>That said, my greatest contribution to Outer Wilds modding has to be creating the magic talking anglerfish Ernesto.</Page>
			<Page>Okay bye.</Page>
