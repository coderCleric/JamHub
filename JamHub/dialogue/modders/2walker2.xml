			<Page>Hello, I'm Walker! I was the lead developer of Astral Codec. I've also worked on the mod jam entries Evacuation, Reflections, Root Access, and Heliostudy.</Page>
			<Page>Astral Codec is one of the biggest projects I've ever worked on and it would never have been finished without the help of many other people, several of whom are attending this very party! I'm really proud to be a part of this community.</Page>
			<Page>If you're reading this and thinking about making a mod yourself, go for it! If you're unsure how to start, ask on the Discord. Or find a team and try making something for the next jam. You never know what you could make.</Page>
			<Page>If you're playing this in the Jam 3 system, my team's entry (Reflections) can be found on Forlorn Project out by the edge of the solar system. Try to avoid being sealed away forever.</Page>
			<Page>If you're playing this in Jam 5, my team's entry (Heliostudy) is the solar system with the holographic purple lines. You should check out the developer commentary (enabled in the options) after playing it!</Page>
			<Page>If you want to chat, feel free to ping me (@2walker2) on the modding Discord! I'm happy to help new modders or to answer questions about any of the mods I worked on.</Page>
