      <Page>Hi! I'm GameWyrm! I'm primarily known for my work on Hearth's Neighbor, and its sequel, Magistarium! </Page>
      <Page>I'm also involved in the Archipelago Randomizer implementation for Outer Wilds! I also created Outer Relics, and worked with xen on a puzzle mod called "Escape Room"!</Page>
	  <Page>I'm also working on a new mod called Halcyon Nexus Zero, so keep a look out for that!</Page>
	  <Page>Anyway, glad to see you here in the community mod jam! If you went here as one of the first places you visited, well, good choice! I bet we'll see each other again soon...</Page>
